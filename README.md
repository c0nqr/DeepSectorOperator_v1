# deep-sector-operator

what we can do so far: jump through gate, mine resource node, defend, kill boss, go home.

controls:
	tab/q: lock target, cycle targets.
	spacebar: auto fire on/off.
	m: call freighter to resource node.
	





TODO:
	- everything. :(
	- clean up folder structure (like that dudes 10k+ lines organization vid).
	- stick with a naming convention, quit mixing.
